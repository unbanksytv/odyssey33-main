## 🤔 What's New

These are the few important improvements to the forked version of art engine that will work 100% with thirdweb NFT project deployments.

### ✅ Generate thirdweb Folder

You can now generate a folder where you can use to drag and drop it to the thirdweb dashboard. You can only run this after you generated your arts via `yarn generate` command. Use the command below to generate a folder for you to use in thirdweb dashboard.

```bash
$ yarn generate_thirdweb
```

If you want to generate the art and create a folder for thirdweb at the same time follow the command below.

```bash
$ yarn generate && yarn generate_thirdweb
```

> **Why not add this to script command?**
> For some reason it is not working on my end, need to update this and bind it on the `yarn generate` script.
> For now, you can use the command above. ✌️

### ✅ Start Count From

You can define your own start count upon generation. Default count is 0. This is to match the default minting token ID with thirdweb.

By default it is `0`.

```js
const startCountFrom = 0;
```

### ✅ Local File Mapping

You can define your own file mapping, you can choose between local file mapping or use the existing pre-uploaded file on IPFS. Make sure to make the `hasBaseUri` to `true` so that the engine will use the defined `baseUri` in the config file.

By default it is `false`.

```js
const hasBaseUri = false;
const baseUri = "ipfs://cid-here";
```

If set to `false` the output would be...

```json
"image": "0.png",
```

If set to `true` the output would be...

```json
"image": "ipfs://<cid-here>/0.png",
```

### ✅ Case Sensitivity

Use only this option if you want to make your layer image filename to case sensitive as trait value or case insentive and make your layer image filename to capitalize instead. By default, set to `false`.

```js
const isLayerNameFileNameAsIs = false;
```

#### Case Sensitive Example

> input: "**AWESOME**#1.png" as layer image filename.
> output: "_AWESOME_" as trait value.

#### Case Insensitive Example

> input: "**AWESOME**#1.png" as layer image filename.
> output: "_Awesome_" as trait value.

### ✅ NFT Dummy Assets
